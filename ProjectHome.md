### About Wait Zar ###

This project has evolved, from a simple plugin which converts romanised Burmese to native text, to a solid multi-font system for typing Burmese at all levels of its computerized history: past (Win Innwa), present (Zawgyi-One), and future (Unicode 5.1).

Community involvement has been overwhelmingly positive, leading to a re-thinking of the Wait Zar romanisation (now in progress), collaboration and support from several developers and forums, and a general positive attitude towards the technology.
